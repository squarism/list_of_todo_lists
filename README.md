## Aptitude, Experience, Skills

I can't even describe my skills.  I don't think our industry can either.
We talk about years of experience when I know it doesn't work that way.  Some years
I'm expanding greatly and others I'm expected to ship and perform.  It isn't even
broken up by years like that.  Maybe it's "have extra energy on weekend 34, 41 and 42".

So how do I even talk about language skills?


## Answering It Myself

I don't have an answer, no one has an answer so I can just find out myself.

Maybe I'm not correct in my base assumption but a good starting point would be
"I can make a TODO list".  I've touched Node.js many times but I was doing Ruby
during the "hype transition" and I never transitioned to it being my primary language.
So ... do I say "I know Node"?  What does that even mean?  So I'm tired of speaking
like this so I'm just going to create TODO lists in every language I can.

Some languages (like Elm for me) are going to be a "first synthesis app" for me.
So part of this repo is to track and log how slow I am in the languages where I'm growing.
